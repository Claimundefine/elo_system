ELO system for Valorant Customs,

Mostly some OCR to detect text and scores from end of game screenshots, elo system with tunability for weighting on kills, deaths, assists, plants.

Stuff to fix:

Maybe refactor some of the files to make main more readable
Have options to undo everything
Admin scripts to directly modify dbs in case of mistakes
